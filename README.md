# steerwell
Sterwell is an app to monitor your speed and send alerts on overspeeding and detect possible crashes.

Created with **react-native**, **[react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps)**, **[react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase)** during a 48 hour hackathon on road safety.
It keeps watching your speed and coords and update the people added with location and speed
and send alert if overspeeded or on sudden decelaration which might be a crash.
